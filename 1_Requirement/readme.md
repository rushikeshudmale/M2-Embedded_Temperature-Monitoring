
## Introducation
The vehicle having major feature. In this technology it is used to determine the presence of the passanger and if the passanger existing in side the car then our system starts the functionality. So in nowdays everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for the new products to made the life easier.
In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the passanger's existance and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

## Used components
Temperature sensor
switches
display
led for indication
potential Switch
resister


## Features
If the passager in side the car than switch is ON
Passanger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication
After the indication it will determine the heat.
Driver and the passanger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
The passanger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system
Modular Based Programming


## SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities threats
###Strengths
User Friendly.
Easy to modify the temperature value
The system is robust
Low cost.
Modular Based Programs
###Weakness
It's only applicable for the countries which are having having low temperature.
###Opportunities
It can be implemented by adding heater along with air conditioners so that it will be helpful all the countries.
###Threats
Not suitable for average or high temperature environment.

## 4W's and 1'H
WHAT Passanger seat and Heat Monitoring System.
WHERE Used in automotive industry,
WHEN At low temperature,
WHY For being healthy.
HOW Operates by modifying the temperature

## Detail Requirement
